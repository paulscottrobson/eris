Image Format
============

Image is built up of bands of multiple colour strips, each 16 pixels wide.
These are built of bands of one colour known as "pixel bands"
Each bands width is a multiple of 16.

This is uncompressed.

Image:
		1 Word : Type ID 	"EI"
		1 Word : Number of horizontal bands overall (e.g. the width is this value x 16)

Band:
		1 Word : Number of pixel bands in this horizontal band (can be zero)
		1 Word : Height of this band (non zero)

Pixel Band:
		1 Word : BGR in bits 0-2, others are zero.
		h Words : 1 word for each row of the band, 16 pixels.

When building a pixel band the following considerations should be made :

	If there are no set pixels at all, (e.g. everything is transparent) then do not generate any
	pixel bands.

	If the pixel band is all the same colour, then generate it for that value of BGR.

	If the pixel band is multi colour, generate it for bits B, G and R if present in the band.

Compressed Format
=================

In the compressed format, bit 15 of the control word of the pixel band indicates compressed data,
which has to be decompressed before being blitted to the screen.

The format is as follows :-

$0000 		End of compressed data.
$01nn 		Repeat the following word nn times
$02nn		Copy the following nn words verbatim

The image drawing routines, which should be capable of scaling x 2 and flipping are in the kernel.

The converter has support for transparency, and allows the scaling and centering of the converted image, 
it takes a class which returns size and pixels/transparency to represent its source object.
